Data Ocean Recursion Ops Technology for Hash-based Y-tokens

web5 cross-chain tech via oracles and utility tokens, with new Merkle Tree capabilities, for future redundancy/user friendly, inherent-by-design legal protection (.block)

Connecting all the currently-siloed chains and allowing them to one day all work together and actually create expoundable, clearly-demonstrable, ethical, inherently-transparent value

Utilizing utility tokens and oracles in a way that further enhances current cross-chain tech and thinking so as provide a relative smooth forward-momentum along the web3-to-web5 timeline, all while somehow feeling as natural as possible
